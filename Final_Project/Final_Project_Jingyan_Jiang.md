## Method and Medium
The method I plan to employ for this project is to use charts to show that there is positive relations between what would otherwise be separate and unrelated datasets. I would start by sketching out the storyline: There is a sharp increase of Amazon stock price during the pandemic.  Between the online shopping growth in general during the same period, and top consumer reasons for shopping online, suggestion can be made that the increase in Amazonâ€™s stock price is beyond all other reasons highly related to the occurrence of the pandemic. 

With this storyline in mind, I would be able to trim off some less related datasets when necessary and add more dataset wherever needed. And I would be able to fit the datasets that remain into the storyline so that they make a solid and strong case in an orderly fashion, and in order to do that I would choose carefully the appropriate chart type for each dataset that it makes a clear and expressive impression. 

In terms of medium, I plan to use Shorthand to make the charts and visualize the story behind them. The reason is that Shorthand is more user friendly than PPT as it is interactive in showing features.
