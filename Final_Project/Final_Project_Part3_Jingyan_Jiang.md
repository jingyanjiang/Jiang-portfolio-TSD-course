# Final Project Part 3

### Project Writeup
#### 1. Idea
At the beginning of this project, I came up with an idea to look into the growth of the online shopping market. As we know, during the pandemic, the e-commerce industry grew rapidly. In this case, I am wondering if there is any investing opportunity in this industry. In order to research this topic, I need to analyze the whole industry and also find the promising individual companies. Since Amazon is the leading company in this industry, I assumed it might be a good candidate decided to select Amazon as the individual company that I wanted to analyze.  

#### 2. Data Collection
In the data collection process, I first searched for the data for the whole industry of e-commerce. After confirming the rapid increase in the industry, I started to find the data for Amazon. The data fits the assumptions I made before.  

#### 3. Data understanding
From the data I collected in the previous steps, I found that the growth of e-commerce market during the pandemic period was faster than previous years. The stock price and the net revenue of Amazon increased also faster during the pandemic period.   

#### 4. Outline
According to this understanding, I constructed my structure as follows.  
- (1) The increase of the Amazon stock price  
- (2) Net revenue of Amazon from 2007 to 2022  
- (3) The increase of retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021  
- (4) The increase of E-commerce as percentage of total retail sales worldwide from 2015 to 2021  
- (5) Leading online marketplaces worldwide  
- (6) Difference of share of consumers who shopped online across the regions  
- (7) Leading reasons among internet users for purchasing a product when shopping online   

#### 5. Initial Sketches
Using the data collected before, I generated some visualizations by Excel to do exploratory data analysis. From this analysis, I figured out the trend of the data and did sketches accordingly.

#### 6. Critique
Based on the sketches I made in previous step, I received some critiques in class from my teammates. The main points are as follows.   
- (1)	Add a title to this page. (Modified)  
- (2)	As for the reasons of online shopping, try to focus more on the leading reasons, which could be achieved by using colors.  
- (3)	Check if the preference changed on shopping is sticky or not.  
- (4)	Try to find potential competitors of Amazon that are hurt in this period.  
 
#### 7.Storyboard
In this step, I first created all the visulizations needed for this story. After that, I tried to create a visual walk-through of the primary elements of my outline, taking the critiques in to consideration. After several reconstructions, I settled the storyline as follows. It can be seen in the part 2. [Final Project-Part 2](/Final_Project/Final_Project_Part2_Jingyan_Jiang.md) 

#### 8. User research
- (1)	Target audience
      Primary audience: Investors who might be interested in Amazon or the e-commerce industry.
      Secondary audience: Loyal customers of Amazon.
      Addition audience: Companies from traditional industries who plan to participate in the e-commerce industry.
- (2)	Approach to identify representative individuals to interview
      I plan to interview investors and customers. As for the investors, I have a friend who is actively trading in the US. Stock market. And for customers, I plan       to reach out to two of my friends who are Amazon prime members.
- (3)	Interview Script
> a)	Brief Introduction:   
      Hi, I am working on a project to investigate the growth of the E-commerce industry and try to deliver the progress I did till now. I am wondering if you could       give me some opinions about it. It would be short.    
> b) Pre storyboard walkthrough:  
      i. Are you a prime member of Amazon? (For Customers)  
      ii. Are you currently looking at the e-commerce industry? (For Investors)  
      iii. How often do you shop online?  
      iv.	What’s the share of your online purchases among all your purchases?  
      v.	What’s your opinion on the e-commerce market?  
> c) Post storyboard walkthrough:  
      i. What do you think the story is about?  
      ii. What impress you most?  
      iii. What is confusing to you or what do you think could be improved?  
      iv. Are you agree with the call to action of this storyboard?  
> d) Wrap up:  
      Thanks for your opinions! I would embed them into the improvement of this project. Hope you have a good day!  
- (4)	Findings from interviews  
      In order to protect the interviewees’ information, I sum up the feedback together as follows.  
> a) Positive:  
      i. The visualization is good as it highlights the main points that I hope to convey. It is clear, easy to understand, and interactive. (From all three                  interviewees)  
      ii. It is an interesting topic.  
> b) Negative:    
      i.	The end conclusions are too broad, maybe try to focus on one.  
      ii.	The storyboard now is too descriptive, and the ideas to be emphasized are not clear.  
      iii.	The call-to-action parts are missing.  

#### 9.	Final modification  
In this final stage, I review my entire storyline with an attentive focus on the audience: what kind of decision they might be expecting to make with the help of this story, what is it that they are looking for but my story has not yet been included. The critiques and feedback of interviews in the user research have pointed out that the current data is too high level to be making sense in an actual decision-making process, and the data is most descriptive that requires a more direct interpretation of the point being made here.   
Based on this feedback, I reviewed my story and tried to locate the problems and come up with a solution to each.  
First, the problem of data being too descriptive without a clear point being made. When I review my story, I found out that I did try to make the case that the reason why the growth would be sustainable is that the pandemic serves more as a way to bring in new customers rather than a strong incentive for people to shop online. So, I assume when the critique says data are most descriptive it is because the wording in my explanation of the significance of the data is not catchy enough and I did not repeat it and reemphasize it enough. So, I modified and highlighted the contrast between two explanations of the growth on several slides:   
- (1) makeshift vs better shopping experience  
- (2) forming habits vs being incentives  
- (3) bringing in customers vs keeping customers  
With more catchy wording that stands out and more repetition from a different perspective, I believe the information is better conveyed.   
Second, the problem of not being able to provide information that is impressive in an actual decision-making process, I decide that it is because a mere demonstration of online-shopping incentives does not make close sense to people’s real life: surveys present themselves as retrospections but do not interact with people like, say, a “Buy Now” button to be clicked on. So I added a graph of the increase in the number of Amazon Prime Members, as Prime-Membership has an actual significance in the audience’s everyday life: free shipment and discounts. The visual aid does not only present information that online shopping is a more serious commitment than just a makeshift: people just love their purchases being delivered to the doorstep that they pay for it to happen more often, but it also presents it via a most typical life scenario that the audience has been encountering and interacting with.   
With these modifications, I believe I have answered the problems raised but my reviewers and made my story a stronger case.
