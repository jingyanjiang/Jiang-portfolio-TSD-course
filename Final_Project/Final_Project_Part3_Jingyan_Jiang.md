#### 1.Idea
At the beginning of this project, I came up with an idea to look into the growth of the online shopping market. As we know, during the pandemic, the e-commerce industry grew rapidly. In this case, I am wondering if there is any investing opportunity in this industry. In order to research this topic, I need to analyze the whole industry and also find the promising individual companies. Since Amazon is the leading company in this industry, I assumed it might be a good candidate decided to select Amazon as the individual company that I wanted to analyze.  

#### 2.Data Collection
In the data collection process, I first searched for the data for the whole industry of e-commerce. After confirming the rapid increase in the industry, I started to find the data for Amazon. The data fits the assumptions I made before.  

#### 3.Data understanding
From the data I collected in the previous steps, I found that the growth of e-commerce market during the pandemic period was faster than previous years. The stock price and the net revenue of Amazon increased also faster during the pandemic period.   

#### 4.Outline
According to this understanding, I constructed my structure as follows.  
- (1) The increase of the Amazon stock price  
- (2) Net revenue of Amazon from 2007 to 2022  
- (3) The increase of retail e-commerce sales worldwide from 2014 to 2021  
- (4) The increase of E-commerce as percentage of total retail sales worldwide from 2015 to 2021  
- (5) Leading online marketplaces worldwide  
- (6) Difference of share of consumers who shopped online across the regions  
- (7) Leading reasons among internet users for purchasing a product when shopping online   

#### 5.Initial Sketches
Using the data collected before, I generated some visualizations by Excel to do exploratory data analysis. From this analysis, I figured out the trend of the data and did sketches accordingly.

#### 6.Critique
Based on the sketches I made in previous step, I received some critiques in class from my teammates. The main points are as follows.   
- (1)	Add a title to this page. (Modified)  
- (2)	As for the reasons of online shopping, try to focus more on the leading reasons, which could be achieved by using colors.  
- (3)	Check if the preference changed on shopping is sticky or not.  
- (4)	Try to find potential competitors of Amazon that are hurt in this period.  
 
#### 7.Storyboard
In this step, I first created all the visulizations needed for this story. After that, I tried to create a visual walk-through of the primary elements of my outline, taking the critiques in to consideration. After several reconstructions, I settled the storyline as follows. First, I would introduce the background that the covid hurts
