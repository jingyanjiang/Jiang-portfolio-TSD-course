#### 3.	Interview Script  
#### Brief Introduction:   
Hi, I am working on a project to investigate the growth of the E-commerce industry and try to deliver the progress I did till now. I am wondering if you could give me some opinions about it. It would be short.  
#### Pre storyboard walkthrough:  
1)	Are you a prime member of Amazon? (For Customers)  
2)	Are you currently looking at the e-commerce industry? (For Investors)  
3)	How often do you shop online?  
4)	What’s the share of your online purchases among all your purchases?  
5)	What’s your opinion on the e-commerce market?  
#### Post storyboard walkthrough:  
1)	What do you think the story is about?  
2)	What impress you most?  
3)	What is confusing to you or what do you think could be improved?  
4)	Are you agree with the call to action of this storyboard?  
#### Wrap up:
Thanks for your opinions! I would embed them into the improvement of this project. Hope you have a good day!  
  
#### 4.	Findings from interviews  
In order to protect the interviewees’ information, I sum up the feedback together as follows.  
#### Positive:  
1)	The visualization is good as it highlights the main points that I hope to convey. It is clear, easy to understand, and interactive. (From all three interviewees)   
2)	It is an interesting topic.  
#### Negative:
1)	The end conclusions are too broad, maybe try to focus on one.  
2)	The storyboard now is too descriptive, and the ideas to be emphasized are not clear.  
3)	The leading incentive for online shopping has nothing to do with this story.  
4)	The call-to-action parts are not convincing.  
5)	Maybe mention some potential problems behind this growth.  
  
#### 5.	Changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week  
1)	Narrow down the ending points for this story.  
2)	Figure out what the call-to-action part should look like.  
3)	Include some potential problems behind this growth instead of just talking about the positive side.
