# Government Debt Chart: Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Data source: https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm

Thoughts:
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits. (Quoted from the OECD website: https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm)  

The bar chart could help us to compare the debt-to-GDP ratio across countries but it can only show the data of one year. We cannot compare the ratio across years. The grid of line charts allow us to compare the ratio across years, and to some extent we can compare it between countries.     

The dot chart combines the two goals. That's also why I would choose this method. We can comapre the ratio both across countries and years. When draging the button on the top-left, we can see the changes of the ratio across years. The size of the dot represents the value of the ratios. Besides, I tried to highlight Japan's dot as it is the largetest but just did not figure out how to implement it.
