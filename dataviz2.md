# Government Debt Chart: Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Data source: https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm

Thoughts:
The bar chart could help us to compare the debt-to-GDP ratio across countries but it can only show the data of one year. We cannot compare the ratio across years. The grid of line charts allow us to compare the ratio across years, and to some extent we can compare it between countries. The dot chart combines the two goals. We can comapre the ratio both across countries and years. When draging the button on the top-left, we can see the changes of the ratio across years. The size of the dot represents the value of the ratios.
