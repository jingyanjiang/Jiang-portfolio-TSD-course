# Jingyan Jiang-portfolio-TSD-course
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Jingyan Jiang is from the Master of Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. She got a Bachelor of Economics degree from Xiamen University. It has always been her passion to solve real-world problems using large-scale data modeling and software engineering. She pursues a career that could make tangible impacts on industry and peopleâ€™s daily life. To achieve her career goal, she changed her career path from economic research to software engineering. She has experience in Python, Java, and Machine Learning. Besides, she also has the quick learning ability. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to use github and how to create and maintain a personal portfolio page. Besides, I am also interested in recovering the stories behind data in a more compelling way with visualization.
